          chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, composition,
          and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), the
          transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released or
          absorbed during these processes. Every substance, whether naturally
          occurring or artificially produced, consists of one or more of the
          hundred-odd species of atoms that have been identified as elements.
          Although these atoms, in turn, are composed of more elementary
          particles, they are the basic building blocks of chemical substances;
          there is no quantity of oxygen, mercury, or gold, for example, smaller
          than an atom of that substance. Chemistry, therefore, is concerned not
          with the subatomic domain but with the properties of atoms and the
          laws governing their combinations and how the knowledge of these
          properties can be used to achieve specific purposes.
