        <h2>Periodic tablisa</h2>
        <p>
          The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of the (chemical)
          elements, is a rows and columns arrangement of the chemical elements.
          It is widely used in chemistry, physics, and other sciences, and is
          generally seen as an icon of chemistry. It is a graphic formulation of
          the periodic law, which states that the properties of the chemical
          elements exhibit an approximate periodic dependence on their atomic
          numbers. The table is divided into four roughly rectangular areas
          called blocks. The rows of the table are called periods, and the
          columns are called groups. Elements from the same group of the
          periodic table show similar chemical characteristics. Trends run
          through the periodic table, with nonmetallic character (keeping their
          own electrons) increasing from left to right across a period, and from
          down to up across a group, and metallic character (surrendering
          electrons to other atoms) increasing in the opposite direction. The
          underlying reason for these trends is electron configurations of
          atoms. The periodic table exclusively lists electrically neutral atoms
          that have an equal number of positively charged protons and negatively
          charged electrons and puts isotopes (atoms with the same number of
          protons but different numbers of neutrons) at the same place. Other
          atoms, like nuclides and isotopes, are graphically collected in other
          tables like the tables of nuclides (often called Segr√® charts).
