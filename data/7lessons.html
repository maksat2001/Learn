          Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of
          matter. It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up
          matter to the compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their
          composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they
          undergo during a reaction with other substances. Chemistry also
          addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds. In the
          scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position
          between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central
          science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic
          and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For
          example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth (botany), the
          formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed
          and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the
          properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications
          work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene
          (forensics).
