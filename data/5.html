          A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the chemical
          transformation of one set of chemical substances to another.[1]
          Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve
          the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical
          bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the
          elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation.
          Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the
          chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both
          electronic and nuclear changes can occur. The substance (or
          substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called
          reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by
          a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually
          have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist
          of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary
          reactions, and the information on the precise course of action is part
          of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with
          chemical equations, which symbolically present the starting materials,
          end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction
          conditions. Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction
          rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration. Typically,
          reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is
          more thermal energy available to reach the activation energy necessary
          for breaking bonds between atoms. Reactions may proceed in the forward
          or reverse direction until they go to completion or reach equilibrium.
          Reactions that proceed in the forward direction to approach
          equilibrium are often described as spontaneous and reduce the free
          energy if they occur at constant temperature and pressure.
