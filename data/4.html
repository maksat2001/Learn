          Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number
          1. Hydrogen is the lightest element. At standard conditions hydrogen
          is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H2. It is colorless,
          odorless, tasteless,[8] non-toxic, and highly combustible. Hydrogen is
          the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting
          roughly 75% of all normal matter.[9][note 1] Stars such as the Sun are
          mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. Most of the hydrogen
          on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic
          compounds. For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each
          atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons. In the early
          universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred
          during the first second after the Big Bang. The emergence of neutral
          hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about 370,000 years
          later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled
          enough for electrons to remain bound to protons.
